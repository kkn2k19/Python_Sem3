# 3. Program to determine whether a given number is a happy number.
#    The happy number can be defined as a number which will yield 1 when it is replaced by the sum of the square of its digits repeatedly. 
#    If this process results in an endless cycle of numbers containing 4, then the number is called an unhappy number.(use math module)
#    For example, 32 is a happy number as the process yields 1 as follows
#    32 + 22 = 13
#    12 + 32 = 10
#    12 + 02 = 1
